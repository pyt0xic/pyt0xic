#### ABOUT ME:
- 👋 Hi, I’m Nic
- 👀 Just a junior engineer with way too much responsibility.
- 🎈 I do everything from .NET Core microservices to helping maintain a 5 million line FoxPro codebase.
- 🌱 Arch BTW (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

#### LEARNING ROADMAP:
1. Learn IaC/Terrafrom
2. Try out some other CI/CD services (Azure/AWS)
3. Learn AWS Lambda and maybe try do a serverless API for fun.
4. Learn gRPC and SignalR
